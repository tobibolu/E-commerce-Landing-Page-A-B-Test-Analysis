# Portfolio Pitch (US Remote Data/AI Roles)

This project demonstrates production-minded experimentation analysis rather than notebook-only exploration. I implemented data contracts, deterministic scripts, statistical inference with confidence intervals and SRM checks, and business-impact scenarios with stakeholder-ready reporting artifacts. The workflow is CI-friendly and asynchronous collaboration-ready for distributed teams.
